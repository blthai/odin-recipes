Odin Recipe Project

This is the first project in The Odin Project course. I will be building a basic recipe website. Now that I have finished the project, I think that I have become a lot stronger in formatting an HTML document from scractch, using links and images, and the biggest improvement being my comfortability with using Git. I made a ton of commits that made me more mindful of saving snapshots of my work. I am looking forward to learning how to work with more branches now and merging as I haven't gotten the opportunity to use those tools yet.
